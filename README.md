Problem Statement:

Price of a property is one of the most important decision criterion when people buy homes. 
Real state firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers . 
Having a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have , which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties , putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property.

I have Uploaded two datasets , housing_train.csv and housing_test.csv . 
For the Following Dataset, I Have used Predictive Model as Linear Regression.
